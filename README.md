# Collection Diffing

A sample demo and dummy mac app to provide an implementation for my custom collection diffing algorithm I talked about in my [blog] (https://www.allaboutswift.com/dev/2019/8/27/custom-collection-diffing).
I could have created a framework for this but decided to do it with this quick and dirty approach due to Swift 5's support of Collection Diffing.
